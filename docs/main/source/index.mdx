Analytics is a lightweight abstraction library for tracking page views, custom events, & identify visitors. It is pluggable & designed to work with any [third-party analytics tool](https://getanalytics.io/plugins/) or your own backend.

##  About the library

Companies frequently change analytics requirements based on evolving business needs.

This results in a lot of complexity, maintenance, and extra code when adding/removing analytic services to a site or application.

This library aims to solves that with a simple pluggable abstraction layer.

### Driving philosophy

- You should never be locked into a analytics tool
- DX is paramount. Adding & removing analytic tools from your application should be easy
- Respecting visitor privacy settings & allowing for opt out mechanisms is crucial
- A pluggable API makes adding new business requests easy

To add or remove an analytics provider adjust the `plugins` you load into `analytics`.

## Features

- [x] Extendable - Bring your own third party tool & plugins
- [x] Test & debug analytics integrations with time travel & offline mode
- [x] Add functionality/modify tracking calls with baked in lifecycle hooks
- [x] Isomorphic. Works in browser & on server
- [x] Queues events to send when analytic libraries are loaded
- [x] Works offline
- [x] Typescript support
- [See the api docs](https://getanalytics.io/api/)


## How to Install

Install the `analytics` package from [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/analytics)

```bash
npm install analytics --save
```

Or from a CDN as a script tag:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/analytics/dist/analytics.min.js"></script>
```

## Using in your app

Initialize analytics, include your analytic tools, & start tracking events.

See the [getting started section](https://getanalytics.io/tutorial/getting-started/) for more details.

```js
import Analytics from 'analytics'
import googleAnalyticsPlugin from '@analytics/google-analytics'
import customerIOPlugin from '@analytics/customerio'

/* Initialize analytics */
const analytics = Analytics({
  app: 'my-app-name',
  version: 100,
  plugins: [
    googleAnalyticsPlugin({
      trackingId: 'UA-121991291',
    }),
    customerIOPlugin({
      siteId: '123-xyz'
    })
  ]
})

/* Track a page view */
analytics.page()

/* Track a custom event */
analytics.track('userPurchase', {
  price: 20
  item: 'pink socks'
})

/* Identify a visitor */
analytics.identify('user-id-xyz', {
  firstName: 'bill',
  lastName: 'murray',
  email: 'da-coolest@aol.com'
})
```
